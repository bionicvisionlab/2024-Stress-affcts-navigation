Abstract: There are known individual differences in both the ability to learn the layout of novel environments
and the flexibility of strategies for navigating known environments. However, it is unclear how
navigational abilities are impacted by high-stress scenarios. Here we used immersive virtual
reality (VR) to develop a novel behavioral paradigm to examine navigation under dynamically
changing situations. We recruited 48 participants (24 female; ages 17–32) to navigate a virtual maze
(7.5 m × 7.5 m). Participants learned the maze by moving along a fixed path past the maze’s landmarks
(paintings). Subsequently, participants experienced either a non-stress condition, or a high-stress
condition tasking them with navigating the maze. In the high-stress condition, their initial path was
blocked, the environment was darkened, threatening music was played, fog obstructed more distal
views of the environment, and participants were given a time limit of 20 s with a countdown timer
displayed at the top of their screen. On trials where the path was blocked, we found self-reported
stress levels and distance traveled increased while trial completion rate decreased (as compared to
non-stressed control trials). On unblocked stress trials, participants were less likely to take a shortcut
and consequently navigated less efficiently compared to control trials. Participants with more trait
spatial anxiety reported more stress and navigated less efficiently. Overall, our results suggest that
navigational abilities change considerably under high-stress conditions.
